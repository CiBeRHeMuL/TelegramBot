### 🌟 Overview

This is a powerful, strictly-typed PHP library for building Telegram bots. It fully leverages the capabilities of **PHP 8.2+** and modern programming
standards to make your development process fast, reliable, and enjoyable.

The library provides a complete toolset for interacting with the **Telegram Bot API**, allowing you to focus on your bot's logic rather than on
low-level implementation details. At its core is a flexible update processing kernel built on `HandlerGroup`, `Checker`, and `Middleware`, ensuring
exceptional modularity and extensibility.
